counting down the minutes until my leaves fall off... need water... now...
@george_guffey can't even water his plant. don't trust this guy with anything
this is my final message... goodbye
What did I do to deserve this?
Oh God, the ferns
Im getting tired.
Its hard to keep my eyes open. Just kidding, plants dont have eyes! I am on the verge of death though.
